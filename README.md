# Audio-Enabled Chatbot with Text-to-Speech Streaming  

Welcome to the **Audio-Enabled Chatbot** project! This repository contains the code for a chatbot interface that combines OpenAI's API with real-time text-to-speech streaming capabilities, delivering a seamless conversational experience with both text and audio outputs.  

---

## Features  

### Version 1  
- **Chat Interface**: A clean, modern interface for user-bot conversations.  
- **Message History**: Tracks the chat history to maintain context.  
- **Real-Time Text-to-Speech**: Converts bot responses into audio for playback.  
- **Audio Playback Controls**: Play, pause, and resume bot responses.  
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle transitions for message rendering and audio playback states.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Indicators for audio states (playing, paused, loading).  

---

## Design  

- **Colors**: Clean whites, soft grays, and accent colors for interactive elements.  
- **Typography**: Modern, readable fonts for clear communication.  
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for messages and pulsing effects for active audio playback.  
- **Layout**: Full-height chat window with a fixed input bar at the bottom.

## Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-chatbot.git  
   cd audio-chatbot  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use the package manager of your choice:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:  
   ```env  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key  
   ```  

4. **Start the Development Server**  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```

## How It Works  

1. **User Interaction**  
   Users type messages into the chat input field and press send.  

2. **Bot Response**  
   The chatbot processes user messages using OpenAI's API and generates a response.  

3. **Text-to-Speech**  
   Bot responses are converted into audio using a text-to-speech streaming service.  

4. **Audio Playback**  
   The interface provides play/pause controls and visual feedback for audio playback states.
